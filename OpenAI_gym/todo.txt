Implement 'Expected Sarsa' for improved Q learning

Implement 'Importance sampling ratio' in off-policy methods (using a 'control variate').
Implement 'Prioritized Experience replay' (based on TD-error, with importance sampling to avoid bias in the update distribution).
Implement 'n-step tree backup algorithm'

Implement 'Double Q learning':
Implement 'Dueling architecture'
Two estimates of Q-function that can switch roles between actor and critic. 
The action is samples according to Q1 + Q2.
At each timestep, only one of the two Q-functions is updated. (why?)


Implement n-step TD methods and understand the impact of 'n'


Implement 'saddle-free Newton's method' to (greatly?) improve performance of high dimensional optimization (e.g. neural nets)

Investigate 'Evolution Strategies' (ES)
Investigate the relation between ES and deep neural networks. (deep neuroevolution)
